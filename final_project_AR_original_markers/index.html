		<h1><u>Khye and Julia's Final Project Documentation</u></h1>
        <p>We worked together for the midterm project so we decided to continue working together for the final project. We enjoyed working on our Pokemon ecosystem for our midterm so we went with making our ecosystem more advanced for the final project.</p>

        <p>When we began working on Assignment 6, we thought we wanted to make our final project a VR project. Then, once we began working on Assignment 7, we realized that we wanted to use AR for our final project instead.</p>
        <p>We had difficulty instantiating the Pokemon objects into the world at first because we didn't understand how the containers worked at first.</p>

        <p>Once we figured that out, we ran into another obstacle: the camera couldn't differentiate between our customized markers well. Our first attempt to fix this problem was to add little squares in different locations on the markers, but that didn't work. Our second solution was to add the Pokemon's names to the markers and that was successful.</p>

        <p>We used a ZB marker to create a floor. The user would be able to hold up our Pokemon markers to drop Pokemon onto our floor. The Pokemon grow in size and even give birth. The user can see when the Pokemon will give birth because an egg will appear above the Pokemon's head.</p>
        
        <p>This is a demonstration of our work:</p>
